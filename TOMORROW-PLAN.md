# TOMORROW PLAN — Shopify Clone Takedown Sprint

## Non-negotiables
- Mini-audit = **1–2 domains max**, no full Evidence Vault, no ready-made filings.
- Payment = **50% upfront + 50% after first responses/first filing proof**.
- Everything tracked in one table (tickets + status + next follow-up).

---

## 07:00–09:00 (2 hours) — Leads + Outreach (first money setup)

### 07:00–08:00 — Build 30–40 hot leads (active incidents)
Goal: 30–40 leads with **recent incident** signals.

Sources (copy/paste searches):
- Reddit: r/shopify, r/ecommerce, r/Entrepreneur
  - query: `clone store` OR `fake shop` OR `lookalike domain` OR `impersonating my brand` OR `cloned store` OR `scam store`
  - filter: last 7–14 days
- Shopify Community: search `clone`, `cloned`, `impersonation`, `lookalike`, `fake store`, `scam store` (last 30 days)
- X (Latest):
  - query: `("clone store" OR "fake Shopify" OR "lookalike domain" OR "impersonating my brand" OR "cloned my store") since:2026-02-01`

Capture per lead:
- Brand name
- Contact handle/email/site
- 1–2 suspicious URLs (if present)
- Link to the incident post

### 08:00–08:30 — Send first 15 outreaches
- 5 active-incident replies/DMs
- 5 cold brands
- 5 backups (incident-lite)

Use hooks:
- “48h Takedown for {Brand} Clones”
- “Impersonation Alert: Chargebacks Incoming?”

CTA:
- “Send 1–2 URLs → I’ll reply with a free 30-min mini-audit one-pager.”

### 08:30–09:30 — Deliver 1 mini-audit one-pager
Goal: produce 1 mini-audit for the fastest responder.

Deliverable must include:
- 3 screenshots + timestamps
- side-by-side proof
- WHOIS/NS/host hints
- top 3 takedown lanes + ETA ranges
- clear sprint offer + payment terms

Close:
- Ask for 50% upfront to start sprint.

## 09:30–12:00 — Sprint execution (if paid)
- Build Evidence Vault
- File first lanes in parallel: **Shopify + CDN/host + registrar + ads/search (if applicable)**
- Start tracker + follow-up cadence: T+6h / 24h / 48h

## Day-end (21:00 recap)
Answer:
1) leads built / outreaches sent
2) replies/calls
3) paid? if no: what blocked + next fix
