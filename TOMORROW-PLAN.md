# TOMORROW PLAN — Shopify Clone Takedown Sprint

## Quick Start: All Artifacts
📋 **Your Daily Toolkit - Access everything from here:**

- [OUTREACH_PACK.md](./OUTREACH_PACK.md) - Ready-to-use outreach scripts for Reddit, X, email, and DM
- [LEAD_TRACKER_TODAY.md](./LEAD_TRACKER_TODAY.md) - Daily lead tracking template
- [MINI_AUDIT_TEMPLATE.md](./MINI_AUDIT_TEMPLATE.md) - One-page mini-audit format
- [SPRINT_STATUS_TRACKER.md](./SPRINT_STATUS_TRACKER.md) - Sprint progress tracker
- [templates/takedown/](./templates/takedown/) - Takedown notice templates (Shopify, registrar, hosting, etc.)

---

## Non-negotiables
- Mini-audit = **1–2 domains max**, no full Evidence Vault, no ready-made filings.
- Payment = **50% upfront + 50% after first responses/first filing proof**.
- Everything tracked in one table (tickets + status + next follow-up).
- **Use artifacts from Quick Start for every step** - don't reinvent the wheel.

## 07:00–09:00 (2 hours) — Leads + Outreach (first money setup)

### 07:00–08:00 — Build 30–40 hot leads (active incidents)
Goal: 30–40 leads with **recent incident** signals.

📖 **Reference:** [LEAD_TRACKER_TODAY.md](./LEAD_TRACKER_TODAY.md) for tracking format

Sources (copy/paste searches):
- Reddit: r/shopify, r/ecommerce, r/Entrepreneur
  - query: `clone store` OR `fake shop` OR `lookalike domain` OR `impersonating my brand` OR `cloned store` OR `scam store`
  - filter: last 7–14 days
- Shopify Community: search `clone`, `cloned`, `impersonation`, `lookalike`, `fake store`, `scam store` (last 30 days)
- X (Latest):
  - query: `("clone store" OR "fake Shopify" OR "lookalike domain" OR "impersonating my brand" OR "cloned my store") since:2026-02-01`

Capture per lead:
- Brand name
- Contact handle/email/site
- 1–2 suspicious URLs (if present)
- Link to the incident post

### 08:00–08:30 — Send first 15 outreaches
Goal: Send 15 targeted messages across channels.

📖 **Reference:** [OUTREACH_PACK.md](./OUTREACH_PACK.md) for battle-tested scripts

Split:
- 5 active-incident replies/DMs
- 5 cold brands
- 5 backups (incident-lite)

Use hooks from OUTREACH_PACK.md:
- "48h Takedown for {Brand} Clones"
- "Impersonation Alert: Chargebacks Incoming?"
- "Your Brand on {Suspicious Domain} — Report Attached"

CTA (from outreach scripts):
- "Send 1–2 URLs → I'll reply with a free 30-min mini-audit one-pager."
- "Free 5-min audit: Paste suspicious URLs here."

### 08:30–09:30 — Deliver 1 mini-audit one-pager
Goal: produce 1 mini-audit for the fastest responder.

📖 **Reference:** [MINI_AUDIT_TEMPLATE.md](./MINI_AUDIT_TEMPLATE.md) for exact format

Deliverable must include (use template):
- 3 screenshots + timestamps
- side-by-side proof
- WHOIS/NS/host hints
- top 3 takedown lanes + ETA ranges
- clear sprint offer + payment terms

Close:
- Ask for 50% upfront to start sprint.
- Link to service agreement if needed.

---

## 09:30–12:00 — Sprint execution (if paid)
Goal: Execute first takedown sprint and build momentum.

📖 **Reference:** [SPRINT_STATUS_TRACKER.md](./SPRINT_STATUS_TRACKER.md) for sprint tracking

Execution steps:
1. Build Evidence Vault (full documentation)
2. File first lanes in parallel:
   - **Shopify** abuse report
   - **CDN/host** abuse (Cloudflare, AWS, etc.)
   - **Registrar** WHOIS violation
   - **Ads/search** removal (Google Ads, Bing Ads)
3. Use templates from [templates/takedown/](./templates/takedown/):
   - `shopify-abuse.md`
   - `registrar-notice.md`
   - `hosting-notice.md`
   - `dmca-template.md`
4. Start tracker + follow-up cadence: T+6h / 24h / 48h
5. Update SPRINT_STATUS_TRACKER.md with every action

---

## Day-end (21:00 recap)
Answer these 3 questions:
1) **Leads built / outreaches sent** → Update LEAD_TRACKER_TODAY.md
2) **Replies/calls** → Log responses in tracker
3) **Paid?** If no: what blocked + next fix

📖 **Update:** [SPRINT_STATUS_TRACKER.md](./SPRINT_STATUS_TRACKER.md) with daily summary
