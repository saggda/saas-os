## Evidence Threshold Decision Matrix

### When to File NOW (≥80% Must-Have)

**File immediately when:**
- ✅ All 5 Must-Have items complete
- ✅ At least 2–3 High-Leverage items included
- ✅ Screenshots <24h old
- ✅ Clear brand impersonation visible

**Total time to collect:** 30–45 minutes

## Platform-Specific Thresholds

### Shopify (Platform)
**Minimum:** Brand ownership + clear impersonation + evidence
**Ideal:** Side-by-side + customer harm
**Note:** Shopify acts faster on phishing/fraud than trademark-only cases

---

### CDN (Cloudflare, etc.)
**Minimum:** Trademark/copyright proof + specific URLs
**Ideal:** Side-by-side + customer harm + screenshots
**Note:** CDNs often forward to host — include host info if available

---

### Registrar
**Minimum:** Domain + clear abuse + brand proof
**Ideal:** All evidence + WHOIS + harm
**Note:** Registrars move slowly — complete evidence helps

---

### Ad Platforms (Meta/Google)
**Minimum:** Ad screenshots + landing URL + impersonation
**Ideal:** Ad Library evidence + side-by-side + harm
**Note:** Ads are high leverage — prioritize these reports

---

### Google Safe Browsing (Phishing)
**Minimum:** Suspicious URL + phishing description
**Ideal:** Screenshots + payment collection evidence
**Note:** Use for actual phishing/data collection, not just counterfeit

## Quick Assessment Rubric

### Score Each Category (0–2)

| Category | 0 = Missing | 1 = Partial | 2 = Complete |
|----------|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| URLs captured | No | Homepage only | 3+ pages |
| Screenshots | None/outdated | Partial | Complete + timestamped |
| Brand ownership | None | Weak proof | Strong proof (TM/corp) |
| Infringement clarity | Vague | Some confusion | Clear impersonation |
| Harm evidence | None | Suspected | Documented |

**Total Score: ___ / 10**

**Interpretation:**
- **8–10:** File now ✅
- **5–7:** Add 1–2 more items, then file ⚠️
- **0–4:** Major gaps — collect more ❌

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Waiting for Perfection
**Don't wait for:**
- Every possible screenshot
- Trademark registration (if not available)
- Customer complaints
- Legal consultation

**File with what you have** — follow-ups can add evidence.

---

### 2. Filing with Old Evidence
**Problem:** Screenshots >48h old
**Risk:** Site changed, evidence outdated
**Solution:** Re-take screenshots if >48h old

---

### 3. Vague Infringement Claims
**Problem:** "They copied my design" (no specifics)
**Risk:** Rejected as insufficient evidence
**Solution:** Be specific: "They copied our logo, product photos, and checkout flow"

---

### 4. Missing Brand Ownership
**Problem:** "I own this brand" (no proof)
**Risk:** Rejected as unauthorized filer
**Solution:** Attach trademark, domain ownership, or corporate registration

---

### 5. Ignoring Customer Harm
**Problem:** No documentation of actual harm
**Risk:** Lower priority
**Solution:** Document chargebacks, complaints, confusion (even 1–2 examples)

---
