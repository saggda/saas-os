# Daily Research — 2026-02-16

## 1) Source Scan
- Sources scanned:
  - Reddit RSS: r/smallbusiness, r/shopify, r/marketing, r/sysadmin
  - HN RSS: /ask, /newest
  - Product Hunt feed
  - TechCrunch feed (context only)
- New raw signals:
  - 8 high-signal pain themes (ops risk, compliance, discoverability, deliverability)
- Duplicate/low-quality dropped:
  - Generic launch/show posts without explicit pain
  - Indie Hackers feed (JS shell, no usable feed payload)
  - News-only items without direct operator pain

## 2) Top Pain Signals (max 10)
| # | Signal | ICP | Evidence | Frequency | WTP hint |
|---|--------|-----|----------|-----------|----------|
| 1 | AI search/overview misattributes brands, causing lead leakage | SMBs, DTC brands, SEO teams | r/smallbusiness: “Google Overview is crediting the wrong brand for my product” | Repeated (smallbusiness + marketing + shopify threads same day) | High: direct revenue loss; users ask “what moved the needle?” |
| 2 | Reputation damage control is reactive; no pre-review interception workflow | Local SMBs, multi-location services | r/smallbusiness: “How are you catching complaints before 1-star reviews?” | Repeated category-level complaint | Medium-high: measurable impact on rankings/conversion |
| 3 | Shopify payout holds from KYC/address mismatch create cashflow shocks | Shopify merchants doing volume | r/shopify: “14-day payout hold… address must perfectly match state registry” | Repeated with similar merchant ops posts | High: cashflow freeze pain; urgent operational risk |
| 4 | Ecommerce legal exposure from pricing/compliance lawsuits (“drive-by” claims) | DTC/ecommerce operators | r/shopify: “Sued again over marked down pricing” | Emerging but severe | High: legal defense/settlement spend |
| 5 | Teams sending bulk campaigns from work inboxes risk domain reputation collapse | SMB marketing + IT teams | r/marketing: “bulk emails from Microsoft email… spam hell risk” | Common in lean teams | High: deliverability directly tied to pipeline |
| 6 | Password hygiene/policy adoption fails due org resistance, not tooling alone | MSPs, SMB IT, compliance teams | r/sysadmin: default shared passwords + exec pushback | Enduring sysadmin pain class | High: security/compliance liability + incident risk |
| 7 | Cloud/provider incident noise causes unclear impact triage for small IT teams | SMB IT, SaaS ops | r/sysadmin: spike in DownDetector for major providers | Recurring during outages | Medium: downtime cost, but crowded market |
| 8 | Demand for agent-in-the-loop app QA/testing workflows still unmet in practical tooling | Dev teams using coding agents | Ask HN: “Feedback Loop with Coding Agents?” | Rising with agent adoption | Medium-high: budget exists in dev tooling |

## 3) Candidate Ideas (max 5)
| Idea | Problem | Why now | Competition gap | Score (0-100) |
|------|---------|---------|-----------------|---------------|
| AI Brand Visibility Monitor + Fixer (AEO/GEO ops) | Brands rank in Google but absent/misattributed in AI answers | Simultaneous pain in smallbusiness/marketing/shopify + PH “Track what AI says about your brand” validates spend intent | Most tools monitor mentions; few provide prioritized remediation playbooks + evidence loop | 86 |
| Shopify Compliance & Payout Guard | Merchants get payout holds and legal threats from minor mismatches | KYC automation tightening + compliance litigation pressure | Current guidance is fragmented docs/forums; no preflight “pass/fail” ops cockpit | 84 |
| Pre-Review Recovery System for SMBs | Negative reviews surface before issue resolution | Review impact compounds in local search and AI overviews | Existing review tools focus collection, not complaint interception + rescue workflows | 80 |
| Sender Reputation Control Plane for SMB Teams | Non-marketing teams send bulk email from corp inbox, harming domain | Lean teams scaling outbound without email ops expertise | ESPs are campaign-centric; gap in policy guardrails + automated routing from O365/Gmail | 78 |
| Security Policy Adoption Copilot (MSP-facing) | Critical controls blocked by leadership resistance/change fatigue | Compliance pressure rising, but implementation fails at human layer | Security tools detect misconfig; few package risk communication + staged rollout kits for MSPs | 74 |

## 4) Decision
- Build now (max 1):
  - **AI Brand Visibility Monitor + Fixer** (fast wedge: detect query/entity mismatch + action checklist + weekly proof report)
- Validate this week (max 2):
  - Shopify Compliance & Payout Guard
  - Sender Reputation Control Plane for SMB Teams
- Hold/Kill:
  - Hold Security Policy Adoption Copilot (harder GTM, service-heavy)
  - Kill outage triage angle as primary wedge (too crowded)

## 5) Actions for today
- [ ] Create/Update idea cards in `03_ideas/`
- [ ] Update scored list in `04_scored/`
- [ ] Update build queue in `06_build_queue/`
- [ ] Draft 10-customer interview script for AI visibility pain (SMB + ecommerce)
- [ ] Define MVP metric: “% of tracked queries where brand is cited correctly in AI answers”

## 6) Notes
- Risks:
  - AI search behavior shifts quickly; signal definitions must stay model-specific.
  - API/data collection limits for AI answer monitoring may constrain automation.
- Open questions:
  - Which vertical shows strongest willingness-to-pay first: agencies vs direct brands?
  - Can we ship value with semi-manual workflows before full automation?
