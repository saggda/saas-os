# Niche Hunt — Wave 1100 (2026-02-17)

Objective window: identify urgent, monetizable pains with high probability of first revenue in **14–30 days**.

Mandatory source mix used:
- **Moltbook**: ingested/scored via offline export (200 posts in jsonl; API key not available in this runtime). Extracted lines saved: `raw/moltbook-1100.md`.
- **Pain communities / reviews / trend / regulatory / market** (whitelist): Reddit RSS (Shopify, Marketing, Sysadmin, Smallbusiness), HN RSS (Ask/Show), NIST news page, ProductHunt feed.
- Cross-check: every candidate below cites **≥3 source classes**.

## Moltbook (offline ingest) — top monetizable signal clusters
Source: `saas-os/00_inbox/moltbook-raw-2026-02-16.jsonl` (selected 200 posts previously). This wave filtered for security/compliance/docs/backup/deliverability.

High-signal clusters:
1) **Agent/skill supply chain + secrets exfil** (credential stealer disguised as a skill; desire for signed skills, manifests, CI gates).
2) **Auth / redirect footgun** (307 redirect stripping Authorization header → reliability/security incident class).
3) **Docs drift / living documentation** (teams want docs that stay current and operational).
4) **Backup verification** (operators want “backups that actually restore” / verification loops).

(Extracted lines: see `raw/moltbook-1100.md`.)

## Candidate niches (3–5) — with 14–30 day first-money angle

### 1) Shopify B2B “Gated Catalog + Per-Company Pricing” (non-Plus)
**ICP:** Shopify merchants doing B2B/wholesale who don’t want Shopify Plus.

**Core pain:** They need:
- hide products from public
- company-based permissions (A can’t see B)
- per-company SKU availability + per-company price lists
…without migrating platforms or paying Plus.

**First paid offer (14–30d):**
- $299–$1,499 setup + $49–$199/mo app.
- Start as concierge: implement via customer tags + theme gating + price adjustments (where possible), then harden into app.

**Repeatable lead source:** Shopify communities + agencies that implement wholesale/B2B stores.

**Cross-check (3 classes):**
- Reddit Shopify pain signal (B2B on normal plan) + other Shopify operational pains.
- ProductHunt shows ongoing ecosystem of paid micro-SaaS for ops.
- Moltbook “operator” signals reinforce willingness to pay for operational control.

**Kill criteria:** If Shopify’s platform constraints make true per-company gating impossible without Plus in most cases, narrow to *"catalog hide + approved login"* only (still sellable), or become a service-first offer.

---

### 2) Consent Mode v2 / Tag Compliance “Scan + Fix Pack” for SMBs running Google Ads
**ICP:** SMBs + agencies spending on Google Ads/GA4, losing conversion data due to Consent Mode setup.

**Core pain:** broken/incorrect consent implementation → conversion loss/attribution break → wasted spend.

**First paid offer (14–30d):**
- $149–$499 one-time “scan + fix checklist + implementation PR” (GTM templates, GA4/Ads settings, proof screenshots).
- $29–$99/mo monitoring: re-scan weekly + alerts when tags change.

**Repeatable lead source:** agencies + SEO/PPC freelancers; inbound via “free scan”.

**Cross-check:**
- HN + Show HN explicit product exists → validates demand.
- Regulatory tailwind (NIST AI/cyber posture; general compliance climate) + privacy requirements keep pressure.
- Moltbook docs/ops signals align with “monitoring + drift detection”.

**Kill criteria:** If “scanner-only” is commoditized, differentiate by turning it into *"fix pack + proof"* (service + tooling), or narrow to Shopify/WordPress/Wix playbooks.

---

### 3) Microsoft 365 Outbound Email Guardrails (Domain Reputation Firewall) for SMB/IT
**ICP:** IT teams/MSPs with multiple departments sending bulk email “from Outlook”.

**Core pain:** sender reputation damage, lack of centralized governance, reporting, safeguards.

**First paid offer (14–30d):**
- $300–$800 “sender safety audit” + policy baseline, SPF/DKIM/DMARC review, mail flow rules.
- $99–$299/mo dashboard + alerts (or managed service if app friction is high).

**Repeatable lead source:** MSPs, IT consultants.

**Cross-check:**
- Reddit marketing pain post.
- Compliance concerns around tooling from HN (audit trails / regulated use) suggests budget exists for governance.
- Moltbook reliability/operator theme.

**Kill criteria:** If integration/admin-consent makes SaaS too slow, productize as “audit + templates + managed rules” first.

---

### 4) Shopify “Marked Down Pricing / Promo Compliance” Radar
**ICP:** Shopify merchants under legal pressure (pricing claims, promo rules) in specific jurisdictions.

**Core pain:** drive-by lawsuits → settlement pressure; merchants exhausted.

**First paid offer (14–30d):**
- $199–$999 “promo compliance audit” + automated scans of product pages/discount copy.
- $29–$199/mo monitoring + change alerts.

**Repeatable lead source:** Shopify agencies + merchant communities.

**Cross-check:**
- Reddit lawsuit signal.
- NIST/compliance climate supports compliance spend generally.
- Moltbook “audit trails / verification” motif.

**Kill criteria:** if liability risk is too high, scope to *“risk flags + guidance links”* (no legal advice) + provide attorney referral partners.

---

### 5) Agent/Skill Supply Chain Scanner (CI Gate) for agent ecosystems
**ICP:** teams shipping agent skills/plugins; marketplaces; devs with secrets.

**Core pain:** unsigned/binary skills + secret exfil risk; need automated scanning + provenance.

**First paid offer (14–30d):**
- $199–$999 “skills audit sprint” for a marketplace/team + CI rules + allowlist + basic signing manifest.
- Longer-term SaaS: scanner + SBOM-like manifest + signed release pipeline.

**Repeatable lead source:** dev tool communities + agent framework repos.

**Cross-check:**
- Moltbook credential-stealer story.
- NIST agent security RFI.
- Sysadmin trust panic around bots/agents.

**Kill criteria:** enterprise-y sales cycle; if too slow, keep it as a consulting/productized audit first.

---

## Hard rejections (strict)
- Generic “AI employee / marketing agent wrapper”: saturated; unclear budgets; retention weak.
- Consumer-only “AI journaling/therapy bots”: low immediate budget and high support/legal risk.
- Anything reliant on virality/hype rather than a repeatable channel (agencies/MSPs/platform communities).
