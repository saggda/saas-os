# Niche Hunt — Wave 1100 (2026-02-18)

Objective window: identify **urgent, monetizable pains** with high probability of **first revenue in 14–30 days**.

## Mandatory source mix (this wave)
1) **Moltbook**: scored 120 posts (offline jsonl) and extracted monetizable signal lines → `raw/moltbook-1100.md`.
2) **Whitelisted pain sources**: Reddit RSS (Shopify, Marketing, Sysadmin, Smallbusiness) + HN RSS (newest) + ProductHunt feed.
3) **Cross-check**: every candidate niche cites **≥3 source classes** (Moltbook + at least two external classes).

---

## Moltbook — monetizable clusters (from `raw/moltbook-1100.md`)
High-signal clusters (interpreted):
- **Agent/skill supply chain security**: “unsigned binary skill.md” + “model swap scandal” + “audit trail logs” → security/compliance spend.
- **Reliability footguns**: “redirect strips Authorization header” → ops tooling + monitoring.
- **Backups that restore**: “backup services agents actually need” → verification loops / restore tests.

These are not niches by themselves unless tied to **budget + distribution** (MSPs, platform marketplaces, compliance).

## Candidate niches (3–5) with 14–30 day first-money angle

### 1) Shopify Conversion Tracking “Fix + Monitor” (Google Ads / GA4) for merchants
**ICP:** Shopify stores running Google Ads / Performance Max who see broken values or misattribution.

**Pain (urgent):** spend is live, but conversion value reporting is wrong → merchants can’t optimize; they either overspend or turn off ads.

**Evidence cross-check (≥3 classes):**
- Shopify tracking complaint: #3.
- Marketing CAC pressure: #15 + budget signal for conversion work: #17.
- Moltbook reliability footgun theme (API redirect stripping auth) supports “monitoring + drift detection” as a product wedge.

**First paid offer (14–30d):**
- Productized service: **$299–$1,500** “tracking audit + fix” (GTM/Shopify/Ads/GA4), delivered with before/after screenshots.
- Optional subscription: **$49–$199/mo** weekly drift checks + alert if values flatten / tags break.

**Distribution:** Shopify agencies, PPC freelancers, “why is tracking broken?” threads.

**Why it’s not hype:** direct tie to ad spend, immediate ROI framing.

---

### 2) Shopify Fraud Triage + “High-Risk Order Verification” workflow
**ICP:** Shopify merchants getting fraud warnings + chargeback anxiety; teams cancel orders and eat false positives.

**Pain (urgent):** fraud signals are noisy; cancellations cost revenue; chargebacks cost fees + account health.

**Evidence cross-check:**
- Fraud confusion / scam patterns: #8, #9, #10, #11.
- Moltbook supply-chain + audit trail signals → merchants want *defensible decision logs*.
- Sysadmin “logs / verification loops” mindset supports “evidence pack” and “repeatable SOP”.

**First paid offer (14–30d):**
- “Fraud SOP + verification kit” + implementation (Shopify Flow rules, email/SMS verification, address checks): **$250–$1,000**.
- Light SaaS later: “decision log + evidence pack generator” for chargeback disputes.

**Distribution:** Shopify community + fraud-prevention app partner channel.

**Kill criteria:** if merchants already use a dominant fraud app and won’t switch; then position as *add-on SOP + chargeback evidence pack*.

---

### 3) Shopify POS → Square migration (brick-and-mortar) + cashflow/payout hygiene
**ICP:** brick-and-mortar shops stuck on Shopify POS hardware instability + payout delays.

**Pain (urgent):** sales happen daily; unreliable POS hardware + delayed deposits is existential.

**Evidence cross-check:**
- Shopify POS reliability + deposit cadence complaint: #2.
- Marketing budget norms (#17) show SMBs do pay for ops work when ROI is immediate.
- Moltbook “verification/ops” theme supports “migration checklist + validation” (inventory, tax, loyalty).

**First paid offer (14–30d):**
- Local/remote migration package: **$500–$3,000** depending on SKUs/registers + staff training.
- Add-on: payout/cashflow dashboard (simple) or weekly reconciliations.

**Distribution:** local business groups + Shopify forums + Square partner ecosystem.

**Kill criteria:** too geography-dependent for solo builder; mitigate by selling “remote migration + training” with templates.

---

### 4) Compliance micro-audit for Shopify promos (“marked down pricing”) + monitoring
**ICP:** Shopify merchants exposed to drive-by promo/pricing lawsuits.

**Pain (urgent):** legal threat → settlement pressure. They want *a checklist + scanners* now.

**Evidence cross-check:**
- Lawsuit signal: #12.
- Moltbook “audit trails” signals support proof + logs.
- HN/docs integrity signal (#24/#25) reinforces “evidence-grade documentation” culture.

**First paid offer (14–30d):**
- **$199–$999** “promo compliance audit” + automated scan report + “fix list” (no legal advice).
- **$29–$199/mo** monitoring for risky copy changes.

**Kill criteria:** legal liability perception; must keep scope to “risk flags + references”, optionally partner with attorneys.

---

### 5) Cert + dependency outage monitoring “for non-enterprise teams”
**ICP:** small SaaS / agencies that get paged when cert issuance/chain incidents hit.

**Pain (urgent):** CA outage breaks issuance/renewals; lost trust/time.

**Evidence cross-check:**
- Google Public CA incident: #22 + #23.
- Sysadmin patch/outage culture: #21.
- Moltbook reliability footgun theme supports guardrails + monitoring.

**First paid offer (14–30d):**
- $19–$99/mo monitoring + weekly “risk digest”.

**Kill criteria:** crowded market; only viable if wedge is very specific (e.g., Google Trust Services / issuance pipeline checks) or bundled into MSP offering.

---

## Strict rejections (this wave)
- “AI technical cofounder / build your app” style products (ProductHunt #Subterranean-type): hype, low budget fidelity, high churn.
- Consumer “AI memory that listens and remembers” (ProductHunt-style): unclear WTP + retention risk.
- Anything that requires long enterprise compliance cycles unless sold as **productized audit** first (Moltbook supply-chain security could be this, but not as SaaS-first).
