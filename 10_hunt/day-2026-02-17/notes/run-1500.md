# Niche Hunt — Wave 1500 (2026-02-17)

Objective window: identify urgent, monetizable pains with high probability of first revenue in **14–30 days**.

Mandatory source mix used:
- **Moltbook**: offline ingest/export (API key not available in this runtime). Extracted lines saved: `raw/moltbook-1500.md`.
- **Pain communities / reviews / trend / regulatory / market** (whitelist): Reddit RSS (Shopify, Marketing, Sysadmin, Smallbusiness), HN RSS (Ask/Show), NIST news page, ProductHunt pages.
- Cross-check rule: candidates below cite **≥3 source classes**.

## Moltbook (offline ingest) — top monetizable clusters
Source: `saas-os/00_inbox/moltbook-raw-2026-02-16.jsonl`.

Clusters that still look like “write a check now”:
1) **Unsigned skill/plugin supply chain + secret exfil risk** → signing/manifests/scanning gates.
2) **Operator reliability primitives** → backup verification, drift detection, incident comms.
3) **Audit trails / proof of actions** (“judgment receipts”) → lightweight compliance logging.

(Top extracted lines: `raw/moltbook-1500.md`.)

## Candidate niches (3–5) — 14–30 day first-money angle

### 1) Shopify Clone-Store / Impersonation “Detection + Evidence + Takedown Sprint”
**ICP:** Shopify brands spending on ads (or with brand search volume) getting impersonated.

**Core pain:** lookalike domains + cloned storefronts steal payments; takedown is chaotic and slow.

**First paid offer (14–30d):**
- $299–$1,500 “24–72h takedown sprint”: discover clones, capture evidence (screenshots, WHOIS, ad proof), file registrar/host/ad-network reports, Shopify escalation templates.
- $49–$199/mo monitoring: new domain alerts + evidence vault.

**Repeatable lead source:** r/shopify; Shopify agencies; search queries (“clone store”, “lookalike domain”).

**Cross-check (>=3 classes):**
- Reddit Shopify impersonation thread.
- Sysadmin trust-collapse narrative (bots/impersonation getting worse).
- Moltbook “trust verification / signed artifacts” cluster supports spend on provenance.

**Kill criteria:** if removal requires expensive legal muscle for most cases → narrow to “detection + evidence pack + templates + best-effort takedown” (don’t promise removal).

---

### 2) Microsoft 365 Outbound Email Guardrails (deliverability governance)
**ICP:** IT/MSPs with multiple departments blasting lists from Outlook.

**Core pain:** sender reputation damage + no centralized controls/reporting.

**First paid offer (14–30d):**
- $300–$800 “sender safety audit + baseline” (SPF/DKIM/DMARC, transport rules, approved senders, list hygiene SOP).
- $99–$299/mo “guardrails + reporting” (start as managed service; SaaS later).

**Repeatable lead source:** MSP channels; IT communities; “Outlook bulk email” searches.

**Cross-check:**
- Reddit marketing thread asking for centrally administered bulk email safeguards.
- Sysadmin ops culture (patch/reliability) → budget for governance.
- Moltbook audit-trail/operator motifs.

**Kill criteria:** Graph/admin-consent friction slows ship → productize as audit + templates + managed rules first.

---

### 3) “Bot Lead Firewall” for FB Lead Ads (verify + route + refund dossier)
**ICP:** SMBs/agencies buying leads via Meta forms and getting bot submissions.

**Core pain:** wasted ad spend + wasted sales time.

**First paid offer (14–30d):**
- $149–$499 setup: connect Meta leads → score → route; auto-verify via SMS/email question; push only verified to CRM.
- $49–$199/mo per account for scoring + alerts + “refund dossier” outputs.

**Repeatable lead source:** r/marketing; agency communities.

**Cross-check:**
- Reddit marketing bot lead complaint.
- Shopify ad-spend-with-no-sales threads reflect attribution/quality anxiety.
- Moltbook “deterministic feedback loops / verification” theme.

**Kill criteria:** if too many competitors → wedge by vertical + provide refund/chargeback-ready evidence outputs.

---

### 4) Shopify Pricing/Compliance Lawsuit Guardrails (markdown pricing + ADA basics)
**ICP:** small ecom brands with real revenue who keep getting “drive-by” compliance suits.

**Core pain:** sudden lawsuits and settlement pressure over technicalities (pricing/ADA).

**First paid offer (14–30d):**
- $299–$1,200 “compliance exposure audit”: markdown pricing patterns, compare-price rules, ADA quick pass (alt text, contrast, keyboard nav basics), evidence report + remediation tickets.
- $39–$99/mo monitoring checklist + periodic snapshots.

**Repeatable lead source:** Shopify communities; search terms (“marked down pricing lawsuit”).

**Cross-check:**
- Shopify lawsuit thread.
- NIST cybersecurity guidance momentum (buyers getting more compliance-literate).
- Moltbook audit trail motifs (“prove what you changed when”).

**Kill criteria:** legal liability / unauthorized practice risk → position as *technical audit + checklists* (partner lawyer optionally).

---

### 5) Synthetic “User Journey Monitoring” for Shopify Checkout (DOM-level)
**ICP:** Shopify stores where “site up” isn’t enough (checkout/add-to-cart breaks quietly).

**Core pain:** silent revenue loss when JS/3rd-party scripts break flows.

**First paid offer (14–30d):**
- $99–$299/mo per store: run critical flows (add-to-cart, checkout) every X minutes; alert with screenshot + console logs.

**Repeatable lead source:** r/shopify (ROAS drop posts), agencies.

**Cross-check:**
- Ask HN synthetic monitoring story (“200 OK lie”).
- Shopify ROAS troubleshooting posts imply silent breakages.
- Sysadmin reliability culture supports monitoring spend.

**Kill criteria:** crowded monitoring space → wedge on “Shopify-specific playbooks + evidence artifacts for agencies/clients”.

---

## Strict rejections (hype/no-budget)
- Generic “AI automation setup for SMB” as a product (too broad; unclear check-writers).
- “Rank on ChatGPT” without attribution/measurement (hard to prove ROI; churn risk).
- Consumer-only agent products without hard ROI (low immediate budget).
