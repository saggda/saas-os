# Niche Hunt — Wave 0700 (2026-02-18)

Objective window: identify urgent, monetizable pains with high probability of first revenue in **14–30 days**.

Mandatory source mix used:
- **Moltbook**: offline ingest from jsonl (API key not available in this runtime). Extracted lines saved: `raw/moltbook-0700.md`.
- **Pain communities / reviews / trend / regulatory / market (whitelist classes)**: Reddit RSS (Shopify, Marketing, Sysadmin, Smallbusiness), HN RSS (Ask/Show), NIST news hub.
- Cross-check rule: each candidate below cites **≥3 source classes**.

## Moltbook (offline ingest) — monetizable clusters that map to “write a check”
Source: `saas-os/00_inbox/moltbook-raw-2026-02-16.jsonl`.

Recurring clusters that translate into B2B spend:
1) **Unsigned skill/plugin supply chain + secret exfil** → scanning/signing/manifest gates.
2) **Operator reliability + audit trails (“receipts”)** → evidence packs, monitoring, incident comms.
3) **Deliverability / governance patterns** (light but present) → guardrails + reporting.

(Top extracted lines: `raw/moltbook-0700.md`.)

## Candidate niches (3–5) — 14–30 day first-money angle

### 1) Shopify Fraud Shield: High-Risk Orders → Verify → Evidence Pack
**ICP:** Shopify stores doing steady daily volume (or running ads) getting hit by fraud / chargebacks.

**Core pain:** owners don’t know which orders are real; they lose money/time and panic-cancel legit orders.

**First paid offer (14–30d):**
- $300–$1,500 **“Fraud triage + ruleset install”** (Shopify Fraud Protect settings, manual review SOP, customer verification flows).
- $49–$199/mo **“Chargeback evidence vault”**: auto-capture order timeline, comms, delivery proof, screenshots; generate dispute packets.

**Repeatable lead source:** r/shopify fraud threads; Shopify agencies; search terms (“high risk orders”, “Shopify fraud”).

**Cross-check (>=3 classes):**
- Reddit Shopify fraud/high-risk order threads (#3–#6).
- Sysadmin accountability/audit-trail instinct (#17).
- Moltbook “audit trails / receipts / trust” cluster.

**Kill criteria:** if it turns into “fraud detection ML” (slow, crowded) → keep it *ops-first*: rules + verification + evidence packet + workflow.

---

### 2) Bot Lead Firewall for Meta/FB Lead Ads (Verify → Score → Route)
**ICP:** SMBs/agencies running Meta lead forms and drowning in bots / fake submissions.

**Core pain:** wasted ad spend + sales time; client churn because lead quality is unprovable.

**First paid offer (14–30d):**
- $149–$499 setup: Meta leads → verify (SMS/email/one-question) → score → route to CRM.
- $49–$199/mo per ad account: ongoing scoring + alerts + **refund dossier** outputs.

**Repeatable lead source:** r/marketing; agencies; “FB leads are bots” type queries.

**Cross-check:**
- Reddit marketing bot leads (#11).
- Shopify “ad spend, no sales” + diagnosis anxiety (#15).
- Moltbook “deterministic feedback loops / verification” theme.

**Kill criteria:** if too competitive → wedge as (a) niche vertical, (b) refund/chargeback dossier, (c) strict routing + audit log.

---

### 3) Shopify POS Rescue (Brick-and-Mortar): Reliability + Payout Speed + Migration
**ICP:** small retail (1–5 locations) using Shopify POS and getting burned by flaky wireless hardware + slow deposits.

**Core pain:** checkout interruptions and cashflow delays.

**First paid offer (14–30d):**
- $500–$2,500 “Retail POS rescue sprint”: diagnose hardware/network; propose wired setup; migration plan to Square if needed; inventory + loyalty mapping.
- Optional $99–$299/mo managed “POS health checks” + incident checklist.

**Repeatable lead source:** r/shopify retail threads; local POS integrators.

**Cross-check:**
- Shopify brick-and-mortar post (#1).
- Sysadmin ops/reliability culture (#16).
- Moltbook operator-reliability cluster.

**Kill criteria:** if it becomes local onsite work → productize as remote audit + playbook + vendor bundle referrals.

---

### 4) Shopify Compliance Guardrails: “Marked Down Pricing” Exposure Audit
**ICP:** Shopify merchants with meaningful revenue who are lawsuit targets.

**Core pain:** sudden suits/settlements over pricing patterns; fear-driven spend.

**First paid offer (14–30d):**
- $299–$1,200 technical audit + remediation tickets + snapshot evidence.

**Cross-check:**
- Shopify lawsuit thread (#7).
- Sysadmin audit/accountability instinct (#17).
- Moltbook “receipts”/evidence cluster.

**Kill criteria:** legal liability → position strictly as *technical audit + documentation* (optional lawyer partner).

---

### 5) (Hold) Unsigned skill/plugin supply-chain scanner (secret exfil detection)
**Why hold:** real pain, but distribution + budgets uncertain unless tied to a platform/marketplace.

---

## Strict rejections (hype/no-budget)
- “Buy it in ChatGPT” store optimization as a standalone product (too fuzzy/SEO-adjacent; hard ROI proof).
- “All-in-one business nerve center” for SMBs (too broad; long cycles).
- Pure ML fraud detection claims (slow, crowded, hard to outperform incumbents).
