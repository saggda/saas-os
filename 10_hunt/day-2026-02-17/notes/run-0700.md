# Niche Hunt Wave — 2026-02-17 07:00 (Asia/Dubai)

Mode: professional
Window objective: urgent, monetizable pains with high probability of first revenue in 14–30 days.

## Mandatory source mix compliance

1) **Moltbook**: used offline export `saas-os/00_inbox/moltbook-raw-2026-02-16.jsonl` (120 posts). Fresh pull failed because `MOLTBOOK_API_KEY` is not available in this runtime.
   - Extracted lines saved to: `raw/moltbook-0700.md`.
2) **External sources** (from allowed classes: docs / community threads / OSS issues / regulatory-ish guidance): Stripe docs, RFC Editor (IETF), HN (Algolia API), GitHub Issues Search API, OpenSSF site, NIST CSRC.
3) **Cross-check**: each top candidate is supported by >=3 source classes.

## Evidence signals (>=20) — with links

### A) Chargebacks / disputes (money leak + ops drag)
1) Stripe defines the dispute/chargeback flow and that disputes reverse payments + dispute fees (direct $ loss + fees). https://docs.stripe.com/disputes
2) Stripe has **reason code**-specific defense requirements (evidence packaging is non-trivial and structured). https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/reason-codes-defense-requirements
3) Stripe explicitly offers **automation** (“Smart Disputes”) → indicates high demand + repetitive evidence-collection work. https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/smart-disputes
4) Stripe warns about “excessive disputes” and “monitoring programs” (network-level penalties risk). https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/measuring
5) Stripe promotes prevention via Verifi/Ethoca programs (early dispute notifications + reminder flows). https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention-preview
6) HN thread: “Doing a chargeback against Google will get your account banned” → chargebacks create serious downstream account/platform risk (not just payment reversal). https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34016389
7) Stripe Radar page markets early dispute notifications and dispute-rate reduction, implying dispute cost + dispute-rate management as persistent pain. https://stripe.com/en-de/radar
8) GitHub (Stripe dispute lifecycle automation): PR describing mapping `charge.dispute.*` events into a loss-event pipeline → teams invest engineering to operationalize disputes. https://github.com/clawbureau/clawbureau/pull/178

### B) Email deliverability / DMARC reporting (security + revenue)
9) DMARC is a formal mechanism for domain-level policy + reporting (aggregate/failure reports are part of standard operations). RFC 7489: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7489
10) HN story: “Sending DMARC reports is somewhat hazardous” (operational + privacy/attack-surface problems in DMARC reporting). https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/spam/DMARCSendingReportsProblems
11) HN: “Show HN: Free Local DMARC Report Analyser” → “Got so many report for DMARC…” (volume + analysis pain). https://dmarc.so/
12) HN: Fraudmarc open-source DMARC analysis system → category exists, but fragmentation/open-source indicates ongoing need & room for opinionated productization. https://github.com/fraudmarc/fraudmarc-ce/
13) GitHub (DMARC parsing ops): multi-inbox support PR for `parse-dmarc` indicates real-world setups with multiple reporting inboxes + complexity. https://github.com/meysam81/parse-dmarc/pull/10

### C) Supply-chain security for artifacts/plugins (budget exists; urgency rising)
14) SLSA describes supply-chain integrity threats and “levels of assurance” as a compliance-like ladder. https://slsa.dev/
15) SLSA is an OpenSSF project (industry collaboration) → procurement pressure + “standard language” forming. https://openssf.org/
16) GitHub org “sigstore” (Software Supply Chain Security) with pinned projects like cosign/rekor → strong ecosystem signal; code signing is table stakes. https://github.com/sigstore
17) HN: “Sigstore: Making sure your software is what it claims to be” → mainstream dev audience attention. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42784892
18) GitHub issue requesting **Cosign signature verification policy** for container replication: “Organizations may require that only signed container images are allowed” → active demand for enforcement tooling. https://github.com/container-registry/harbor-satellite/issues/257
19) NIST SSDF SP 800-218 explicitly positions secure software development as a set of practices and a common vocabulary for producers/purchasers. https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/218/final
20) GitHub issue: “standardize SLSA L3 provenance across workflows” (Microsoft repo) → teams are implementing SLSA provenance, not just discussing it. https://github.com/microsoft/edge-ai/issues/174
21) HN SBOM stories show ongoing attention to SBOM tooling and “modern embedded Linux images” with SBOMs → compliance/workflow keeps growing. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43131902

### D) Audit logs / governance (compliance & internal control demand)
22) NIST SSDF emphasizes common vocabulary for purchasers/consumers to communicate requirements to suppliers → auditability becomes procurement friction. https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/218/final
23) GitHub search surfaces huge volume of “audit log” feature requests, e.g., open PR “Audit log” (example of constant demand across software products). https://github.com/nashtech-garage/ntg-jvm-agent/pull/215
24) HN search results include a note “No SOC2, No Audit Logs…” and products marketing SOC2/audit logs as enterprise features → “audit log” is a purchasable checkbox in B2B. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46977714

## Candidate niches (3–5)

### 1) DMARC aggregate report inbox → actionable deliverability & spoofing alerts for SMBs
**Problem**: DMARC aggregate reports are noisy + operationally tricky; SMBs and agencies don’t turn them into actions (block spoofing, fix alignment, improve inboxing), causing revenue risk.

**First paid offer (14–30d)**:
- “DMARC Inbox Triage” (setup + ongoing monitoring): connect IMAP inbox(es), parse reports, weekly action list, alert on new unauthorized senders.
- Pricing: $199–$499/mo (or $500 setup + $150/mo) aimed at small SaaS / ecommerce / agencies.

**Repeatable lead source**: MSPs, email deliverability consultants, cold email agencies; outbound lists from “DMARC record missing/misconfigured” scanners.

**Strict anti-hype check**: Budget is usually present when email affects pipeline/revenue; clear ROI (deliverability + brand spoofing reduction).

Cross-check classes: RFC/docs + HN + GitHub.

### 2) Agent governance: approvals + immutable audit log for AI-driven actions (browser/RPA/API)
**Problem**: As “agentic” workflows touch business systems, teams need approvals, RBAC, replayable logs, and “who/what did it” evidence.

**First paid offer (14–30d)**:
- A thin proxy/SDK that wraps agent tool calls (HTTP, Playwright/browser, DB) and writes immutable event logs + approval gates.
- Sell as “compliance pack” for small teams piloting agents in ops/finance.

**Repeatable lead source**: AI automation agencies, internal tool builders, “AI agent for X” implementers.

**Strict anti-hype check**: Only sell where stakes are real (money movement, customer comms, admin access). Avoid generic “AI governance platform” fluff.

Cross-check classes: HN + GitHub + NIST/SSDF framing.

### 3) Chargeback/dispute ops autopilot for Stripe merchants (evidence pack, auto-respond, root-cause dashboards)
**Problem**: Disputes reverse funds + fees; evidence collection is manual + time-sensitive. Even with Stripe Smart Disputes, many merchants have multi-channel evidence (app logs, support transcripts) that isn’t automatically assembled.

**First paid offer (14–30d)**:
- “Dispute Evidence Pack Generator” that pulls from: Stripe, Shopify, support (Zendesk/Intercom), shipping/tracking, screenshots, ToS acceptance logs.

**Strict anti-hype check**: Competes with Stripe’s native automation; must focus on segments Stripe doesn’t cover well (non-eligible, multi-processor, high-touch evidence).

Cross-check classes: Stripe docs + HN + GitHub.

### 4) AI agent / skill supply-chain signing + verification (SLSA-lite) for teams shipping agent plug-ins
**Problem**: Plugin/skill ecosystems create a new supply-chain surface. Teams need signing, provenance, and “allow only verified publishers” gates.

**First paid offer (14–30d)**:
- Consulting+tooling: “Signed releases for MCP/agent tools” pipeline template (GitHub Actions + cosign) + verification gate.

**Strict anti-hype check**: Budget exists in security, but distribution may be slower unless you target teams already subject to procurement checks.

Cross-check classes: SLSA/OpenSSF + HN + GitHub issues + NIST.

## Quick reject list (explicit hype/no-budget)
- Generic “AI agent marketplace” / “agent OS for everyone” — unclear budget owner, long sales cycle.
- Pure crypto/prediction-market tooling — noisy + regulatory drag, not 14–30d revenue for solo.

## Notes on Moltbook
The Moltbook export for 2026-02-16 is heavily meta/agent-community oriented; still, it reinforced *security/governance* themes (supply chain, incidents, trust/audit logs). Because the export lacks permalinks/urls, I did **not** count Moltbook items toward the “evidence signals with links” quota.
