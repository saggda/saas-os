## 2) Candidate niches (3–5) — strict anti-hype filter

### Candidate A — Shopify clone-store + lookalike domain takedown ops (SLA + monitoring)
**ICP:** Shopify/DTC brands + agencies.
**Pain:** direct revenue theft, brand damage, chargebacks; urgent.
**WTP:** high (it’s literally money leaking).
**First-money path (14–30d):** “48-hour takedown concierge” ($500–$5k) + monitoring ($99–$499/mo).
**Distribution:** agencies, Shopify partner ecosystem, ecom operators, fraud-focused communities.
**Cross-check:** r/shopify pain + sysadmin/domain escalation patterns + PH adjacent monitoring.

### Candidate B — Facebook Lead Ads bot-lead filter + auto-protect
**ICP:** local services + B2B lead-gen spending $1k–$50k/mo.
**Pain:** bot leads waste ad spend + sales time.
**First-money path:** plug-in + weekly reports; auto-pause bad adsets; CRM quarantine.
**Cross-check:** r/marketing pain + market trend of ad fraud + measurable ROI.
**Rejection guard:** must show *qualified-lead rate lift* in 7–14 days or kill it.

### Candidate C — Microsoft 365 bulk-email guardrails (“deliverability firewall”)
**ICP:** SMBs on M365; MSPs/IT consultants.
**Pain:** employees blasting lists from Outlook/Shared mailboxes nukes reputation; downstream impacts on sales/support.
**First-money path:** “deliverability risk audit” ($300–$1k) → policy + monitoring subscription.
**Cross-check:** marketing ops demand + sysadmin/M365 alert triage patterns.
**Rejection guard:** not an ESP; it’s governance + prevention.

### Candidate D — Shopify promo/price compliance radar (marked-down pricing, disclaimers, evidence logs)
**ICP:** high-revenue merchants at real lawsuit risk.
**Pain:** compliance uncertainty + legal threat.
**First-money path:** storefront scan + lint rules + weekly alerts; strict disclaimers (not legal advice).
**Cross-check:** r/shopify lawsuit signal + broader compliance/security pressure in news.

### Candidate E — AI agent/skill supply-chain scanner (narrow, not “AI security platform”)
**ICP:** teams installing agent skills/plugins.
**Pain:** credential-stealer skills, unsigned manifests, hidden network calls.
**First-money path:** CI gate + scanner + “security receipt” PDF.
**Cross-check:** Moltbook supply-chain + TechCrunch security climate + sysadmin suspicion culture.

## 3) Notes on hard rejections (hype/no-budget)
Rejected (for *this* 14–30d window):
- Generic “AI marketing agent” / “AI note app” ideas (crowded + unclear budget).
- Broad “AI security platform” without a narrow, provable wedge.
