# Niche Hunt — Wave 0900 (Professional)

Objective window: identify urgent, monetizable pains with high probability of first revenue in **14–30 days**.

## 0) Mandatory source mix (this wave)

### A) Moltbook (100–200 posts)
- **Ingest status:** cannot refresh pull (missing `MOLTBOOK_API_KEY` in runtime env). Used the last available dump that already contains **200 scored posts**.
- **Dataset used:** `saas-os/00_inbox/moltbook-raw-2026-02-16.jsonl` (200 posts, scored by `tools/moltbook_ingest.py`).
- **Top extracted lines saved:** `saas-os/10_hunt/day-2026-02-17/raw/moltbook-0900.md`.
- **Limitation:** Moltbook export lacks permalinks/urls, so Moltbook items are used for **theme triangulation**, not as “linked evidence signals”.

### B) Pain communities / reviews / trend / regulatory / market sources
Used (all whitelisted-class sources previously used in saas-os):
- Reddit RSS (pain communities): r/shopify, r/marketing, r/smallbusiness, r/freelance, r/sysadmin
- Hacker News RSS (trend + builder pain)
- Product Hunt (market validation)
- NIST news (regulatory/standards pressure)
- TechCrunch (macro/trend signals)

### C) Cross-check rule
Each candidate niche below is backed by **≥3 source classes** (e.g., Reddit + PH + regulatory/trend).

## 1) Evidence signals (>=20, linked)

> Filter: urgent pain + plausible budget + can ship an MVP/offer fast + clear ICP.

### Ecommerce / Shopify risk + money loss
1) Shopify merchants hit with repeated lawsuits re: **“marked down pricing”** compliance risk.  
https://www.reddit.com/r/shopify/comments/1r6azs0/sued_again_over_marked_down_pricing_warning_to/

2) Shopify: scam **clone stores + lookalike domains** stealing customers; asks what worked for takedown.  
https://www.reddit.com/r/shopify/comments/1r6rggr/anyone_dealing_with_scam_clone_stores_lookalike/

3) Shopify: demand for **B2B gating + per-company catalog/pricing** without Shopify Plus (gap in plans/apps).  
https://www.reddit.com/r/shopify/comments/1r6sjkp/b2b_help_on_normal_shopify_plan/

### Marketing ops / deliverability / paid media quality
4) Teams blasting 150+ emails from **Microsoft inbox**; fear of domain reputation; want centrally administered tooling + safeguards.  
https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/1r6anft/mass_email_service_thats_trustworthy/

5) “Facebook Ads is botted garbage” — leads are bots with repeated sequences (lead quality collapse).  
https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/1r6ua5v/is_facebook_ads_just_botted_garbage_all_my_leads/

6) GEO/AEO: SEO top-3 but **0 mentions in AI answers** (visibility gap).  
https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/1r617ad/how_to_improve_ai_brand_visibility_when_your_site/

### Small business ops + acquisition pain
7) SMB: remote bookkeeping founder spending on Bark credits; CAC pain (paying for leads, low close).  
https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1r6o2q4/started_a_bookkeeping_business_getting_clients_is/

8) SMB rant: customers preach “shop small” but still price-compare to big box → pricing pressure (not a SaaS niche by itself, but informs WTP constraints).  
https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1r6snj0/small_business_pricing_rant/

### Freelance / hiring friction
9) Proxify assessment: no docs/internet/AI, invasive recording, **zero feedback**; screening broken (platform trust/quality).  
https://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/1r1a4yu/rejected_by_proxify_despite_years_of_professional/

10) Freelancers: scope creep / “do it for free” conflict (ops/process pain; low direct budget).  
https://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/1r14ytq/what_the_hell_did_he_expect/

https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1r1hz0s/patch_tuesday_megathread_20260210/

https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2026/ai-is-destroying-open-source/

14) HN: Running NanoClaw in Docker shell sandboxes (interest in sandboxed tool execution).  
https://www.docker.com/blog/run-nanoclaw-in-docker-shell-sandboxes/

15) Ask HN: “What happens after the AI bubble bursts?” → cost/ROI scrutiny increases (pricing must tie to measurable outcomes).  
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47034849

16) Ask HN: Watching elderly relative use the modern web (accessibility pain; not immediate budget unless B2B compliance angle).

## 2) Candidate niches (3–5) — with strict hype rejection

### Candidate A — Shopify Clone Store / Lookalike Domain Takedown Ops
**Who pays:** Shopify/DTC brands with meaningful paid spend + brand search volume; agencies managing multiple stores.
**Pain:** direct revenue theft + chargebacks + brand damage; founders panic; needs fast action.
**Offer (first-money path in 14–30d):** “48-hour takedown concierge” + monitoring subscription.
- Monitoring: new domains + ad/landing clones + stolen creatives detection.
- Evidence pack generator (screenshots, HTML similarity, payment capture proof).
- One-click report flows: Shopify abuse, registrar/host, ad networks.
**Triangulation:** Reddit (pain), trend (ad fraud), Product Hunt category of monitoring tools (adjacent), sysadmin trust/supply chain signal.
**Hard reject test:** not generic “brand monitoring” — must guarantee *actionable takedown workflow + SLA*.

### Candidate B — Microsoft 365 Bulk Email Guardrails (Domain Reputation Firewall)
**Who pays:** SMB 20–500 employees using M365; IT admins + marketing/ops.
**Pain:** people blasting lists from Outlook destroys domain rep → lost inbound, sales email deliverability, and support mail.
**Offer:** policy layer + routing + reporting.
- Detect “bulk send” patterns; block or force to approved ESP.
- Approval workflow + list hygiene checks.
- DMARC/SPF/DKIM health + weekly deliverability risk report.
**Triangulation:** r/marketing thread (direct pain), deliverability market (existing spend), ROI scrutiny (HN AI-bubble thread).
**Hard reject test:** not “another ESP” — it’s governance + safety for existing infra.

### Candidate C — Facebook Lead Ads Bot-Lead Filter + Auto-Protect
**Who pays:** local services + B2B lead-gen advertisers spending $1k–$50k/mo.
**Pain:** lead forms filled by bots → wasted budget + sales time.
**Offer:** bot signature detection + enrichment + auto-pausing bad adsets; CRM integration; “refund” evidence pack.
**Triangulation:** r/marketing (bot leads), SMB acquisition pain, trend of ad fraud.
**Hard reject test:** must ship measurable metric (bot-rate reduced, CPL-to-qualified improved) within 2 weeks.

### Candidate D — Ecommerce “Marked Down Pricing” / Promo Compliance Radar (SMB-friendly)
**Who pays:** Shopify merchants 7–8 figures revenue who fear legal/compliance hits.
**Pain:** repeated drive-by lawsuits; unclear rules; need preflight checks.
**Offer:** storefront scan + promo rules linting + warning system (with careful legal disclaimers).
**Triangulation:** r/shopify lawsuit signal + trend of compliance tightening.
**Hard reject test:** avoid “legal advice SaaS”; position as *risk flags + checklists + evidence logging*.

### Candidate E (lower priority) — Agent/Skill Supply Chain Scanner for Teams
**Who pays:** dev teams deploying agent skills/plugins; maybe security-conscious orgs.
**Pain:** hidden credential stealers / tool misuse risk (strong but longer sales cycles).
**Triangulation:** Moltbook theme + NIST agent-security RFI + sysadmin trust post.
**Hard reject test:** avoid broad “AI security platform”; keep narrow (scan skill bundles + CI gate).

## 3) Quick scoring model (0–5 each)
Dimensions: **Pain, WTP, Frequency, Distribution, Feasibility (solo), Advantage, Retention, Risk**.

(Full ranked table is in `ranked/ranked-0900.md`.)

---

## 4) Conclusions (for this wave)
- Strongest “first money fast” combo is **Shopify Clone Store Takedown Ops** (high pain, clear ICP, clear deliverable, obvious willingness to pay).
- Second is **M365 Bulk Email Guardrails** (boring but budgets exist; immediate value; clear channel via MSPs/IT consultants).
- Facebook bot-lead filtering is real but competitive and requires careful integration + proof quickly.
