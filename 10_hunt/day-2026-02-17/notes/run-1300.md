11) Sysadmin: “No more hard drives?” (capacity planning / procurement shock)
- https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1r7oq7w/no_more_hard_drives/

12) Marketing: acquisition getting harder (organic reach down, ads expensive, SEO competitive, email deliverability harder)
- https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/1r7d1tq/what_marketing_is_actually_working_for_you_in_2026/

13) Smallbusiness: micro-business invoicing frustration (pricing vs needs; payment fees on large invoices)

### Hacker News (tech + buyer context)
14) Ask HN: “missing middleware layer between LLM agents and the web” (fragile DOM automation pain)
- https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47058763

15) Ask HN: “How are indie AI app builders monetizing in 2026 without killing UX?” (monetization pressure)
- https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47058667

### Product Hunt (market + competition signal)
16) Observability for agents shipped as a product ("ClawMetry for OpenClaw") — proves teams pay for agent ops
- https://www.producthunt.com/products/clawmetry

17) “Open blivz” = alternative to Clay (crowded lead-gen automation category; caution: high competition)
- https://www.producthunt.com/products/blivz

18) GitOps for Docker Compose on low-resource VPS ("Konta") — ops tooling demand on small infra
- https://www.producthunt.com/products/konta

### Secondary cross-links (from HN Ask item)
19) Multi-post “Grok notification” security scare across subreddits (shows consumer-level security panic loops; less B2B)
- https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47057216

### Additional Moltbook trust/integrity signals
20) “Agent Verify / proved I’m trustworthy” (trust scoring as demanded UX)

## B) Candidate niches (3–5) — first-money plausibility focus

### 1) **Agent skill / plugin supply-chain security** (signing + SBOM + scanner + policy gate)
**ICP:** teams running agent ecosystems (OpenClaw / internal skill registries), platform maintainers, security-minded operators.
**Offer (first paid):** “Skill registry gate” that blocks unsigned/unscanned skills; produces audit report + receipts.
**Fast path:** start as CLI + GitHub action + hosted dashboard; sell to 5–20 seat teams.

Cross-check:
- Moltbook: supply chain attack + signed-skills pressure (signals 1–2)
- NIST: securing agent systems tailwind (signal 6)
- Product Hunt: agent observability product exists → buyers exist (signal 16)

### 2) **Shopify chargeback dispute automation** (evidence pack builder + 1-click submission)
**ICP:** Shopify merchants with consistent sales + recurring disputes.
**Offer (first paid):** “Chargeback autopack” that pulls order timeline, tracking proof, comms, ToS acceptance, device fingerprint, refund policy → produces issuer-ready PDF + templated responses; tracks outcomes.
**Fast path:** Shopify app + integrations (Shopify orders, shipping carriers, email provider) + manual review upsell.

Cross-check:
- Reddit: explicit pain + WTP implied (signal 7)
- Market: chargebacks = direct revenue leak (budget exists); plus Shopify POS complaints indicate willingness to switch for better ops (signal 8)
- (Optional next wave) Reviews: G2/Capterra categories (chargeback management) to validate competitors + gaps.

### 3) **Agent audit logs / “judgment receipts” for compliance**
**ICP:** teams deploying LLM agents in regulated environments (finance/health), plus internal security/compliance.
**Offer (first paid):** drop-in SDK that records tool calls + rationale + data lineage + redaction; generates audit exports.

Cross-check:
- Moltbook: judgment logs framing (signals 5,20)
- NIST: agent-system security RFI (signal 6)
- HN: agent/web fragility discussion implies need for stable tooling + logs (signal 14)

### 4) **Log-investigation assistant for sysadmins** (query recipes + “explain this incident” receipts)
**ICP:** sysadmins on-call / small IT teams.
**Offer (first paid):** a “log case file” generator for common incidents (auth failures, suspicious access, patch regressions) that outputs a shareable timeline + evidence.

Cross-check:
- Reddit sysadmin: log spelunking obsession / time sink (signal 9)
- Moltbook: operator mindset + incident/monitoring themes (signals 3–4)
- Product Hunt: ops tools still shipping (signal 18)

---

## C) Strict rejects (hype/no-budget / too crowded)

- Generic “AI marketing tool / growth hacks” → extremely crowded + low willingness to pay without clear ROI.
- “Free creator toolkit” style products (Show HN / ProductHunt) → B2C pricing pressure + churn.
- “Micro-invoicing app for 5–10 invoices/month” → obvious pain (signal 13) but WTP likely capped + heavy competition; only viable as wedge into payments, otherwise weak.

---

## D) Immediate next actions (if we choose top candidate)

If **Agent skill supply-chain security** is picked:
- Define MVP: signature verification + static scan + secrets access detection + sandbox execution profile.
- Sell as: GitHub Action + policy file + badge (“scanned/signed”) + PDF audit export.

If **Shopify chargebacks** is picked:
- Build evidence pack generator first (PDF + templated responses) before attempting full issuer submission automation.
- Pilot with 3–5 stores; charge per dispute pack or % recovered.
