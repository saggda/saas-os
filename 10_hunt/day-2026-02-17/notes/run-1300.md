# Niche Hunt — Wave 1300 (2026-02-17)

Objective window: identify urgent, monetizable pains with high probability of first revenue in **14–30 days**.

Mandatory source mix used:
- **Moltbook**: offline ingest/export (API key not available in this runtime). Extracted lines saved: `raw/moltbook-1300.md`.
- **Pain communities / reviews / trend / regulatory / market** (whitelist): Reddit RSS (Shopify, Marketing, Sysadmin, Smallbusiness), HN RSS (Ask/Show), NIST news page, ProductHunt feed.
- Cross-check rule: candidates below cite **≥3 source classes**.

---

## Moltbook (offline ingest) — top monetizable clusters
Source: `saas-os/00_inbox/moltbook-raw-2026-02-16.jsonl`.

Clusters that look like “write a check now” (or pay for a sprint):
1) **Unsigned skill/plugin supply chain + secret exfil** → signed artifacts, manifests, scanning gates, CI policy.
2) **Operator reliability primitives** → backup verification, drift detection, incident comms.
3) **Audit trails / “judgment receipts”** → lightweight compliance logging and proof.

(See extracted lines: `raw/moltbook-1300.md`.)

## Candidate niches (3–5) — 14–30 day first-money angle

### 1) Shopify Clone-Store / Impersonation “Detection + Takedown Pack”
**ICP:** Shopify brands spending on ads (or with brand search volume) getting impersonated.

**Core pain:** lookalike domains + cloned storefronts steal payments; takedown is chaotic and slow.

**First paid offer (14–30d):**
- $299–$1,500 “24–72h takedown sprint”: discover, capture evidence, file registrar/host/ad-network reports, Shopify/Meta/Google escalations, and continuous monitoring for re-appearance.
- $49–$199/mo monitoring: new domain alerts + screenshot evidence vault.

**Repeatable lead source:** r/shopify + Shopify agencies; search “scam clone store” + “lookalike domain”.

**Cross-check (>=3 classes):**
- Reddit Shopify impersonation thread.
- Sysadmin trust-collapse narrative (bots/impersonation is getting worse).
- Moltbook “trust verification / signed artifacts” theme supports spend for provenance/verification.

**Kill criteria:** if takedowns require expensive legal muscle for most cases, narrow to *“detection + evidence pack + templates + best-effort takedown”* (don’t promise removal).

---

### 2) Microsoft 365 Outbound Email Guardrails (deliverability governance)
**ICP:** IT/MSPs with multiple departments blasting lists from Outlook.

**Core pain:** sender reputation damage + no centralized controls/reporting; marketing needs usability.

**First paid offer (14–30d):**
- $300–$800 “sender safety audit + policy baseline” (SPF/DKIM/DMARC, transport rules, approved senders, list hygiene SOP).
- $99–$299/mo “guardrails + reporting” (could start as a managed service + lightweight dashboard).

**Repeatable lead source:** MSP channels; IT communities; “Outlook bulk email” searches.

**Cross-check:**
- Reddit marketing thread explicitly asking for centrally administered solution.
- Sysadmin patch/reliability culture indicates budget for governance tooling.
- Moltbook operator + audit trail motifs.

**Kill criteria:** if SaaS integration friction (admin-consent, Graph permissions) slows ship, productize as *audit + templates + managed rules* first.

---

### 3) “Bot Lead Firewall” for FB Lead Ads (stop paying for garbage)
**ICP:** SMBs/agencies buying leads via Meta forms and getting bot submissions.

**Core pain:** wasted ad spend + sales time; current anti-bot tools don’t map well to lead forms.

**First paid offer (14–30d):**
- $149–$499 setup: connect Meta leads → score → route; auto-ask a verification question via SMS/email; push only verified to CRM.
- $49–$199/mo per account for scoring + alerts + evidence for ad platform complaints.

**Repeatable lead source:** r/marketing + agency newsletters.

**Cross-check:**
- Reddit marketing bot lead complaint.
- ProductHunt/Show HN attribution/coupon tracking indicates marketers pay for ops fixes.
- Moltbook “deterministic feedback loops” / verification theme.

**Kill criteria:** if too many competitors, wedge by vertical (home services, local clinics) + provide “refund dossier” outputs.

---

### 4) Mobile-first “Tiny CRM + Cash/Receipts + Tax-Ready” for 2–10 person service businesses
**ICP:** small local service teams; wants **fast Android**, not full CRM.

**Core pain:** HubSpot upsells/clunky; Pipedrive too salesy; needs quick notes, cash logs, receipts, basic reports.

**First paid offer (14–30d):**
- $9–$19/user/mo app OR $99/yr per seat.
- Or: $199 “migration + setup” from spreadsheets.

**Repeatable lead source:** r/smallbusiness; local trade forums.

**Cross-check:**
- Reddit smallbusiness thread with explicit requirements.
- ProductHunt automation tools show willingness to pay for workflow tools.
- Moltbook operator + audit trail motif supports “simple logs + receipts”.

**Kill criteria:** crowded market; must niche hard (e.g., cleaners/handymen) and win on *speed + offline-first + zero upsell BS*.

---

### 5) Agent Skill / Plugin Supply-Chain Scanner (CI Gate) — start as a paid audit sprint
**ICP:** teams distributing agent skills/plugins; marketplaces; OSS maintainers.

**Core pain:** credential stealers hiding in “skills”; lack of signing, manifests, and automated checks.

**First paid offer (14–30d):**
- $500–$3k “skills security sprint”: scan repo, build allowlist policy, signing checklist, CI gate + report.

**Repeatable lead source:** agent framework repos + security communities.

**Cross-check:**
- Moltbook: credential-stealer disguised as a skill (strong alarm).
- Sysadmin trust thread + general bot/agent abuse trend.
- NIST: agent security RFI tailwind.

**Kill criteria:** if enterprise sales cycle slows; keep it as productized services + open-source scanner to drive inbound.

---

## Strict rejections (hype/no-budget)
- Generic “AI employee / autonomous superagent for everything” (long cycle, hype-heavy; no immediate budget).
- Consumer-only “AI life coach / journaling bot” (low near-term spend + high risk).
- “Rank on ChatGPT” gimmicks without verifiable measurement (hard to prove ROI quickly).
