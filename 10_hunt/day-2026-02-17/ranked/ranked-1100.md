# Ranked Niches — Wave 1100 (2026-02-17)

Scoring: 0–5 each dimension.
Dimensions: **Pain, WTP, Frequency, Distribution, Feasibility, Advantage, Retention, Risk**.

Interpretation notes:
- **Risk**: 5 = low risk (good), 0 = high risk.
- Bias: prefer niches with **immediate budget** + **repeatable lead source** + **low execution drag** + **clear first paid offer**.

## Ranking (top 5)

| Rank | Niche | Total (/40) | Why it wins/loses fast |
|---:|---|---:|---|
| 1 | **Shopify B2B Gated Catalog + Per-Company Pricing (non-Plus)** | **33.0** | Clear “I will pay to stop this” operational need; distribution via Shopify agencies; MVP can start as concierge + theme/tag gating. |
| 2 | **Consent Mode v2 / Tag Compliance Scan + Fix Pack** | **31.5** | Direct paid-ads wastage; easy “free scan → paid fix”; fast close via agencies; monitoring upsell. |
| 3 | **Microsoft 365 Outbound Email Guardrails** | **30.5** | IT pain + budget; sticky; channel via MSPs; some integration/false-positive risk. |
| 4 | Shopify Marked-Down Pricing / Promo Compliance Radar | 28.0 | Strong legal-stress pain, but liability + geo-specific rules increase drag. |
| 5 | Agent/Skill Supply Chain Scanner (CI Gate) | 25.5 | Real problem + regulatory tailwind, but ICP skews security/devtools → slower sales; keep service-first.

## Score breakdown

### 1) Shopify B2B Gated Catalog + Per-Company Pricing (non-Plus) — **33.0/40**
- Pain **4.5** (B2B operations blocked; platform constraint)
- WTP **4.0** (B2B merchants/wholesale have budget)
- Frequency **4.0** (daily ordering once deployed)
- Distribution **4.5** (Shopify agencies + community posts)
- Feasibility **4.0** (start with “gated catalog + approved login”, expand to per-company rules)
- Advantage **3.5** (execution + Shopify-specific playbooks)
- Retention **4.0** (once pricing rules live, hard to rip out)
- Risk **4.5** (mostly operational; low legal)

Primary evidence:
- Direct request: https://www.reddit.com/r/shopify/comments/1r6sjkp/b2b_help_on_normal_shopify_plan/

First paid offer (14–30d):
- $299–$1,499 setup + $49–$199/mo.

Kill criteria:
- If Shopify APIs can’t support per-company product visibility in a reliable way for most merchants, narrow to “catalog hide + approved login + price list rules where possible” and sell as service-first.

### 2) Consent Mode v2 / Tag Compliance Scan + Fix Pack — **31.5/40**
- Pain **4.5** (lost conversion tracking = wasted spend)
- WTP **4.0** (paid media budgets exist)
- Frequency **3.5** (setup is one-time; monitoring makes it recurring)
- Distribution **4.5** (agencies, PPC freelancers; “free scan” funnel)
- Feasibility **4.0** (scanner + templates; can do manual fixes fast)
- Advantage **3.0** (scanner commoditizes; win with fix packs + proof)
- Retention **3.5** (monitoring + drift alerts)
- Risk **4.5** (low legal if framed as technical diagnostics)

Evidence:
- Consent Mode scanner validation: https://tagintegrity.com/

First paid offer (14–30d):
- $149–$499 scan+fix, then $29–$99/mo monitoring.

## Strict hype/no-budget rejections (wave-specific)
- “SEO/blogger Cursor-equivalent AI” as a generic idea (too broad; unclear WTP; would need massive differentiation). Reference demand signal only: https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/1r6y6zh/dev_has_cursor_and_claude_code_what_do_we_have/
- “AI employee 24/7” directories/marketplaces: saturated; budgets unclear; retention weak.
