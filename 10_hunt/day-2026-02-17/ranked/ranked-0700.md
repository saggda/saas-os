Scoring model: `saas-os/tools/score_ideas.py` (0..5 per dimension; weighted → 0..100)

## Ranking (high → low)

1) **DMARC aggregate report inbox → actionable deliverability & spoofing alerts for SMBs**
   - Score: **74.5** — **VALIDATE_HARD**
   - Why it’s high: frequent recurring reports; clear $ tie to revenue + brand; feasible for solo to ship fast.
   - Main risks: crowded category; must differentiate with “actionability” + MSP/deliverability-channel distribution.

2) **Agent governance: approvals + immutable audit log for AI-driven actions (browser/RPA/API)**
   - Score: **72.0** — **VALIDATE_HARD**
   - Why it’s high: real enterprise checkbox (audit logs/approvals); high retention once embedded.
   - Main risks: distribution; can drift into “platform” scope—must start thin (proxy + logs + approvals) and target high-stakes workflows.

3) **Chargeback/dispute ops autopilot for Stripe merchants (evidence pack, auto-respond, root-cause dashboards)**
   - Score: **70.0** — **VALIDATE_HARD**
   - Why it’s high: direct money leak + fees; budget owner obvious (merchant/revops/fraud).
   - Main risks: Stripe native automation (Smart Disputes/Radar) compresses differentiation; must target gaps (multi-source evidence, non-eligible disputes, non-Stripe processors).

4) **AI agent / skill supply-chain signing + verification (SLSA-lite) for teams shipping agent plug-ins**
   - Score: **66.5** — **VALIDATE_HARD**
   - Why it’s decent: security budgets exist; aligns with procurement trends (SLSA/SBOM/cosign).
   - Main risks: smaller immediate market today; buyer education and sales cycle could exceed 30 days unless positioned as “done-for-you signing pipeline + policy gate”.
