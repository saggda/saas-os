# Ranked Niches — Wave 0900 (2026-02-17)

Scoring: 0–5 each dimension.
Dimensions: **Pain, WTP, Frequency, Distribution, Feasibility, Advantage, Retention, Risk**.

Interpretation notes:
- **Risk**: 5 = low risk (good), 0 = high risk.
- Bias: prefer niches with *immediate budget* + *repeatable lead source* + *low execution drag* + *clear first paid offer*.

## Ranking (top 5)

| Rank | Niche | Total (/40) | Why it wins/loses fast |
|---:|---|---:|---|
| 1 | **Shopify Clone Store / Lookalike Domain Takedown Ops** | **33.5** | Direct money loss + urgent; service-first can close in days; easy distribution via Shopify agencies. |
| 2 | **Microsoft 365 Bulk Email Guardrails (Domain Reputation Firewall)** | **32.0** | Clear IT pain + budget; simple MVP; channel via MSPs; sticky once installed. |
| 3 | Facebook Lead Ads Bot-Lead Filter + Auto-Protect | 29.0 | Real spend + pain, but integrations + competition + proving attribution quickly is harder. |
| 4 | Ecommerce “Marked Down Pricing” / Promo Compliance Radar | 28.0 | Strong pain, but legal sensitivity/liability and geo-specific rules add drag. |
| 5 | Agent/Skill Supply Chain Scanner (CI gate) | 25.5 | Important, but ICP skews security/enterprise → longer sales; still a good wedge if scoped tight. |

## Score breakdown

### 1) Shopify Clone Store / Lookalike Domain Takedown Ops — **33.5/40**
- Pain **5.0** (revenue theft + brand damage + chargebacks)
- WTP **4.5** (paid spend merchants will pay to stop the bleeding)
- Frequency **4.0** (not daily, but once hit it’s urgent; monitoring creates ongoing frequency)
- Distribution **4.5** (Shopify agencies + founder communities)
- Feasibility **4.0** (MVP = monitoring + evidence packs + workflow; can start as concierge)
- Advantage **3.5** (execution + SLA + playbooks; data moat later)
- Retention **4.0** (monitoring subscription + incident history)
- Risk **4.0** (operational + some legal/process risk, but manageable with careful wording)

Primary evidence:
- Shopify clone-store pain thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/shopify/comments/1r6rggr/anyone_dealing_with_scam_clone_stores_lookalike/
- Compliance/lawsuit backdrop (merchants already stressed): https://www.reddit.com/r/shopify/comments/1r6azs0/sued_again_over_marked_down_pricing_warning_to/

First paid offer (14–30d):
- $499–$1,999 “takedown sprint” per incident (48–72h evidence + submissions + tracking) + $99–$299/mo monitoring.

Kill criteria:
- If merchants insist Shopify/registrars are too slow and won’t pay for “paperwork”, drop.

### 2) Microsoft 365 Bulk Email Guardrails — **32.0/40**
- Pain **4.5**
- WTP **4.0**
- Frequency **4.5** (continuous governance)
- Distribution **4.0** (MSPs, IT consultants)
- Feasibility **4.0** (policy + routing + reporting; start with “audit + policy pack”)
- Advantage **3.5** (workflow + controls; not a commodity ESP)
- Retention **4.5** (once in place, hard to rip out)
- Risk **3.0** (integration + false blocks; must be careful not to break business comms)

Primary evidence:
- Direct pain post: https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/1r6anft/mass_email_service_thats_trustworthy/

First paid offer (14–30d):
- $300–$800 “Sender Safety Audit” + $99–$299/mo policy dashboard.

Kill criteria:
- If O365 integration friction is high (admin consent), pivot to “audit/report + training + policy templates” productized service first.

## Hard rejections (explicit)
- Generic “AI employee / agent wrapper” tools: saturated + unclear budgets + retention risk.
- Consumer-only “accessibility helper” for elderly web browsing: real pain but weak direct budget + high support.
- Anything dependent on vague AI hype or “virality” rather than a repeatable lead source.
