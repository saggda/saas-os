>
> **The good news:** There's a 24–72h path to getting it taken down.
>
> I run a **Takedown Sprint service** specifically for Shopify brands:

## 2. Cold Email for Meta Ad Library Brands

**Use when:** You find a brand running ads on Meta/Google, and they likely have clone risk (high SKU, recognizable brand, founder-run DTC).

### Subject Line Options (A/B Test)

**Option A (Urgency):** 
> Impersonation Alert: Chargebacks Incoming?

**Option B (Direct):** 
> 48h Takedown for [BRAND] Clones

**Option C (Value):** 
> Fake Domain Stealing Your Sales? Quick Fix

**Option D (Curiosity):** 
> Lookalike Site Detected – Remove in 24h

### Email Body

> **Subject:** [SUBJECT_CHOSEN]
>
> Hi [FIRST_NAME],
>
> I was browsing Meta Ad Library and noticed you're running ads for **[BRAND]** — solid creatives.
>
> **Quick heads-up:** Clone stores and lookalike domains are spiking right now. When they hit, it's chaos: stolen orders, chargebacks, brand damage.
>
> **I handle this for you** — **48h Takedown Sprint:**
> - Find all clones (domain variations, lookalikes, copycats)
> - Capture admissible evidence (screenshots, source, timestamps)
> - File reports to Shopify/CDN/registrar/ads in parallel
> - Track everything until it's down
>
> **Already see suspicious sites?** Send me 1–2 URLs and I'll reply with a **free mini-audit one-pager** — no cost, just to show you what's possible.
>
> **No suspicious sites yet?** Let's do a **preventive sweep** this week. 15 minutes.
>
> Best,
> [YOUR_NAME]
> [PHONE] | [EMAIL]
>
> **P.S.** Every hour a clone runs, you're bleeding money. Most brands I work with discover clones only after chargebacks hit. Don't wait for that.

**Character count:** ~980
**Success metric:** Reply with URLs or request for preventive sweep

### Personalization Notes

**For high-spend brands (k+/mo on ads):**
> "I see you're investing heavily in ads — clones are literally stealing your ad spend. Even 1% diversion is real money."

**For founder-run brands:**
> "As a founder, you don't have time to chase abuse tickets. I handle the tedious ops so you can keep selling."

**For brands with strong visual identity:**
> "Your creatives are being copied. That's actually good for your case — I can prove impersonation quickly."

## 3. Agency Partner Pitch Script

**Use when:** Reaching out to Shopify agencies (multiplier channel — they resell to their clients).

### Email Body

> **Subject:** White-label clone store takedown for your clients
>
> Hi [NAME],
>
> Quick question: **Your clients eventually get impersonated.** Clone stores, lookalike domains, copied creatives.
>
> **What do you do when it happens?**
>
> Most agencies don't have a dedicated takedown operation. You're focused on growth, not incident response.
>
> **I can be your white-label "clone store response" team:**
> - You keep the client relationship
> - I run the incident playbook + evidence + filings + tracking
> - You resell at your own margin
>
> **How it works:**
> 1. Client comes to you with a clone problem
> 2. You loop me in (or I work behind the scenes)
> 3. I deliver the sprint: 24–72h takedown
> 4. You look like a hero
>
> **Pricing:** Wholesale rates for agencies. Or revenue share — your call.
>
> Want to test this on 1 case? I'll do the first sprint at agency pricing just to prove it works.
>
> Best,
> [YOUR_NAME]

**Character count:** ~820
**Success metric:** Reply with interest in test case

### Follow-Up for Agencies (3–4 days later)

> **Subject:** Re: White-label takedown
>
> Any thoughts on this?
>
> **Reality:** One of your clients will get hit this quarter. When they do, having a response ready is the difference between "hero agency" and "sorry, not our scope."
>
> Let's just agree on a referral arrangement — no commitment until you need it.
>
> [YOUR_NAME]

**Character count:** ~410
**Success metric:** Referral agreement or test case agreement

## 7. Notes & Best Practices

### Personalization Works
- Always include [BRAND] name
- Reference specific details (ad creatives, post content)
- Show you've done 30 seconds of research

### Urgency Sells
- Clone stores are time-sensitive
- Every hour = money lost
- Chargebacks accumulate

### Social Proof Matters
- Mention [X] cases handled
- Share "18 hour" takedown stories
- Use specific numbers when possible

### CTA Clarity
- **Primary CTA:** "Send 1–2 URLs"
- **Secondary CTA:** "Preventive sweep"
- **Tertiary CTA:** "Save my email for later"

### What to Avoid
- Don't promise guaranteed takedowns
- Don't overcomplicate the message
- Don't sound like a lawyer (you're ops, not legal)
- Don't follow up more than 3 times without a reply

- P.S. lines (with vs without urgency)
- Send times (morning vs afternoon vs evening)

**Track:**
- Open rates (if using email tracking)
- Reply rates
- URLs received per email sent
